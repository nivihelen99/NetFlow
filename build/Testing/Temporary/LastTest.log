--- Phase 4: Interface and VLAN Configuration Example ---

1. Configuring Physical Ports...
  Configured Port 1.
  Port 1 Config:
    Admin Up: Yes
    Speed: 1000 Mbps
    MTU: 1500
  Configured Port 2.
  Port 2 Config:
    Admin Up: Yes
    Speed: 10000 Mbps
    MTU: 9000
  Port 1 is admin up: Yes
  Setting Port 2 admin state to down.
  Port 2 Config:
    Admin Up: No
    Speed: 10000 Mbps
    MTU: 9000

2. VLANs are managed via port configurations.

3. Configuring Port VLAN properties...
  Configured Port 1 for ACCESS mode, VLAN 10.
  Port 1 VLAN Config:
    Mode: ACCESS
    Native VLAN: 10
    Allowed VLANs: 10
    Tag Native: No
  Port 2 Config:
    Admin Up: Yes
    Speed: 10000 Mbps
    MTU: 9000
  Configured Port 2 for TRUNK mode, Native 1, Allowed 1,20,30.
  Port 2 VLAN Config:
    Mode: TRUNK
    Native VLAN: 1
    Allowed VLANs: 1 20 30
    Tag Native: No

4. Testing should_forward...
  Should Port 1 forward to Port 2 on VLAN 10? (P1:Access 10, P2:Trunk allow 1,20,30 native 1): No
  Reconfigured Port 2 to allow VLAN 10 on trunk.
  Port 2 VLAN Config:
    Mode: TRUNK
    Native VLAN: 1
    Allowed VLANs: 1 10 20 30
    Tag Native: No
  Should Port 1 forward to Port 2 on VLAN 10 now? Yes
  Should Port 1 forward to Port 2 on VLAN 20? (P1:Access 10, P2 allows 1,10,20,30): No

5. Removing VLAN 20 from Port 2...
  Port 2 VLAN config after removing VLAN 20 from allowed list:
  Port 2 VLAN Config:
    Mode: TRUNK
    Native VLAN: 1
    Allowed VLANs: 1 10 30
    Tag Native: No
