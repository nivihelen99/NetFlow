# --- Example ACL CLI Interaction (Named ACLs) ---

# This script demonstrates how to configure and manage named Access Control Lists (ACLs)
# and apply them to interfaces using the NetFlow++ CLI.

# 1. Create Named ACLs
# --------------------
# ACLs must be created before rules can be added to them.
acl create INGRESS_FILTER_1
# Expected: ACL 'INGRESS_FILTER_1' created.

acl create EGRESS_POLICY_X
# Expected: ACL 'EGRESS_POLICY_X' created.

# Attempt to create an existing ACL (should fail or inform)
acl create INGRESS_FILTER_1
# Expected: Error: Failed to create ACL 'INGRESS_FILTER_1' (it may already exist or name is invalid).

# List all configured ACL names
show acl-rules
# Expected:
# Configured ACLs:
#   INGRESS_FILTER_1
#   EGRESS_POLICY_X

# 2. Add Rules to a Named ACL
# ----------------------------
# Rules are added to a specific named ACL.
# Rule 1 (for INGRESS_FILTER_1): Deny TCP traffic from 192.168.1.10 to any on port 80
acl INGRESS_FILTER_1 rule add id 10 priority 100 action deny protocol tcp src-ip 192.168.1.10 dst-port 80
# Expected: ACL rule 10 added/updated in ACL 'INGRESS_FILTER_1'.

# Rule 2 (for INGRESS_FILTER_1): Permit UDP traffic to DNS server 8.8.8.8
acl INGRESS_FILTER_1 rule add id 20 priority 110 action permit protocol udp dst-ip 8.8.8.8 dst-port 53
# Expected: ACL rule 20 added/updated in ACL 'INGRESS_FILTER_1'.

# Rule 3 (for EGRESS_POLICY_X): Deny any traffic to MAC 00:DE:AD:BE:EF:00
acl EGRESS_POLICY_X rule add id 5 priority 200 action deny dst-mac 00:DE:AD:BE:EF:00
# Expected: ACL rule 5 added/updated in ACL 'EGRESS_POLICY_X'.

# 3. Compile Named ACLs
# ---------------------
# Rules within an ACL are sorted by priority during compilation for efficient evaluation.
acl INGRESS_FILTER_1 compile
# Expected: ACL 'INGRESS_FILTER_1' compiled.
acl EGRESS_POLICY_X compile
# Expected: ACL 'EGRESS_POLICY_X' compiled.

# 4. Show ACL Rules
# -----------------
# Show rules for a specific ACL
show acl-rules INGRESS_FILTER_1
# Expected: Lists rule 20 (prio 110) then rule 10 (prio 100)

# Show a specific rule within a named ACL
show acl-rules INGRESS_FILTER_1 id 10
# Expected: Shows details for rule 10 in INGRESS_FILTER_1

# Show rules for another ACL
show acl-rules EGRESS_POLICY_X
# Expected: Lists rule 5

# 5. Apply Named ACLs to Interfaces
# ---------------------------------
# Configure interface 1 (Gi0/1) and apply INGRESS_FILTER_1 to its ingress direction
# and EGRESS_POLICY_X to its egress direction.
interface 1 ip access-group INGRESS_FILTER_1 in
# Expected: ACL 'INGRESS_FILTER_1' applied to interface 1 ingress.
interface 1 ip access-group EGRESS_POLICY_X out
# Expected: ACL 'EGRESS_POLICY_X' applied to interface 1 egress.

# Verify by showing interface configuration
show interface 1
# Expected output for interface 1 should now include:
#   Ingress ACL: INGRESS_FILTER_1
#   Egress ACL: EGRESS_POLICY_X

# Attempt to apply a non-existent ACL (should fail)
interface 1 ip access-group NON_EXISTENT_ACL in
# Expected: Error: Failed to apply ACL 'NON_EXISTENT_ACL' ... (ACL may not exist)

# 6. Observe ACLs in Action (Conceptual)
# --------------------------------------
# - A TCP packet from 192.168.1.10 to any host on port 80, arriving on interface 1,
#   should be DENIED by INGRESS_FILTER_1 (rule 10).
# - A UDP packet to 8.8.8.8 on port 53, arriving on interface 1,
#   should be PERMITTED by INGRESS_FILTER_1 (rule 20).
# - If a permitted packet is then forwarded out of interface 1, and its destination MAC
#   is 00:DE:AD:BE:EF:00, it should be DENIED by EGRESS_POLICY_X (rule 5).

# 7. Remove ACL from Interface
# ----------------------------
no interface 1 ip access-group in
# Expected: ACL removed from interface 1 ingress.
show interface 1
# Expected: Ingress ACL: Not Set

no interface 1 ip access-group out
# Expected: ACL removed from interface 1 egress.
show interface 1
# Expected: Egress ACL: Not Set

# 8. Remove an ACL Rule
# ---------------------
acl INGRESS_FILTER_1 rule remove id 20
# Expected: ACL rule 20 removed from ACL 'INGRESS_FILTER_1'.
acl INGRESS_FILTER_1 compile
show acl-rules INGRESS_FILTER_1
# Expected: Only rule 10 should be listed.

# 9. Delete a Named ACL
# ---------------------
# (Ensure ACL is not applied to any interface first, though current implementation might not check this)
acl delete INGRESS_FILTER_1
# Expected: ACL 'INGRESS_FILTER_1' deleted.
acl delete EGRESS_POLICY_X
# Expected: ACL 'EGRESS_POLICY_X' deleted.

show acl-rules
# Expected: No ACLs configured. (Or only other ACLs if more were created)
